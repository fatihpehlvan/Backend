This is my internship project at Ar√ßelik.

I developed a web app to manage product demands between two departments (R&D and Production and Material Planning) by using Spring Boot and MySQL.

Users can only login to the system after they are entered into the database.

There are 3 types of roles: User, UPY, and Admin
All roles can create requests in this system however only UPYs and admins accept or reject requests.

Admins can also delete users or UPYs or admins from the system. Moreover, Admins can change the roles.
